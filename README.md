## Purpose
  This project will consist of developing a simple web application that, on a high level, takes a CSV file of user data as input (training data), and produces an accurate machine learning model that the user can re-use to make predictions on similar datasets. A machine learning model is created, and when the user submits an input table, an output table is returned as a CSV file.
  
  This project, in an academic and practical sense, will be useful to develop my skills with machine learning and building simple web applications. I am at the very least familiar with all of the technologies I plan to use, and will use this as an opportunity to extend those skills and become more proficient particularly with processing and transferring large amounts of data quickly between the web application layer and database layer - an issue that I have encountered in internships in unrelated contexts.
  
  This tool will provide value to scientists, mathematicians, students, and machine learning hobbyists who lack a programming background but want to reap the benefits of simple machine learning algorithms - or for those who have the necessary background but want to create machine learning models quickly and easily. Ultimately, this tool will simplify the complicated process of creating these models.
